1. Reproduce the following behaviour with `for..in` loop.

```
a
b
c
d
```

```js
	const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

	for (...)

```

2. Write a check for a palindrome.

```js
const str = 'kayak';

...
```

3. Write a code to display jagged 2D array:

```js
const array = [0, [1, 2], null, 3, [4, 5, 6]];

// expected output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 (separated by newline)
```

TIP: _typeof_ from previous exercises might be useful.
