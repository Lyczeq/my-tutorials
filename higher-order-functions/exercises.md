1. Let's say we have the following array:

```js
const characters = [
  {
    name: 'Anakin Skywalker',
    type: 'Jedi',
  },
  {
    name: 'Darth Maul',
    type: 'Sith',
  },
  {
    name: 'Yoda',
    type: 'Jedi',
  },
  {
    name: 'Count Dooku',
    type: 'Sith',
  },
];
```

Using Higher Order Functions return an array with **Jedis** only.

2. 1. Let's say we have the following array:

```js
const numbers = [2, 5, 11, 6, 9, 3];
```

Using Higher Order Functions:

1. Return an array with the squared numbers.
2. Find the first element that is greater than 35.
