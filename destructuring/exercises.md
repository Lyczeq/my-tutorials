1. Using spread operator, combine two following arrays into one:

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'lemon'];
const vegetables = ['tomato', 'potato', 'carrot'];
```

2. Using spread operator, copy the following object but add your own property, be creative :)
   What will happen if you add the property that already exists?

```js
const car = {
  year: '2021',
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red',
};
```

3. Using the spread operator and a special function to find a max value of the following array:

```js
const array = [2, 5, 13, 8];
```
