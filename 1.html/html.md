# HTML

## So what is HTML actually?

HTML is a language (markup one tho, not programming one) that describes what should be displayed in the user interface.

It consists of a tree composed by nodes - each of them define a particular section of a given document. A node - or **element** is represented in a **tag** form:

```html
<a href="http://www.pokemon.com" id="my-link">Pika Pika!</a>
```

Where: - "a" (anchor) is element rendered. - `<a>` and `</a>` are opening and closing tags. - `href` and `id` are attributes. - "Pika Pika!" is just a text we put inside.
