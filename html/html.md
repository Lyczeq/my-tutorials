# HTML

## So what is HTML actually?

HTML is a language (markup one tho, not programming one) that describes what should be displayed in the user interface.

It consists of a tree composed by nodes - each of them define a particular section of a given document. A node - or **element** is represented in a **tag** form:

```html
<a href="http://www.kowboje.pl" id="my-link">Yeehaw</a>
```

Where:
    - "a" (anchor) is element rendered.
    - `<a>` and `</a>` are opening and closing tags.
    - `href` and `id` are attributes.
    - "Yeehaw" is just a text we put inside.
